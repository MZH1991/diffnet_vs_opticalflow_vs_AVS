Two images, upper one is labeled "before" and the lower one is "after" the movement. These images are the exact ones being used in the code I shared earlier. They are known as "random dot images," which are widely used in vision experiments and motion detection studies. As you can see, the dots are randomly distributed in a binary pattern, where each pixel is either black or white, representing the absence or presence of a dot.

In my work, these images are used to test motion detection algorithms such as DiffNet and optical flow methods. Although these patterns may seem random or noisy, they are actually ideal for studying motion detection because they provide a controlled yet challenging input. Specifically, I use these images to simulate directional changes and examine how well the system detects movement from the "before" image to the "after" image.

Feel free to ask any questions about how this works or how the system processes these images!
